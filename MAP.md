# Asolaria — THE MAP (how these repos connect)

One system, split across repos. This map is identical in every repo — find this repo by name in the
tables below to see where you are; follow the links to walk the rest.

## Prism/Comb 0-loss (2026-07-01) — satellite entry (this repo: the emitter)

**Law (CANON):** every prism/comb operation in Asolaria is a bijection; entropy is invariant under
bijection (`H(f(X)) = H(X)`), so the fabric re-relates information with **0 loss** — and it never
claims compression below entropy (Shannon's `E[bits] ≥ H(X)` always stands). One fabric, two
directions: **forward = comb** (collision-avoidance, execution isolation) · **backward = prism**
(collision-causation, interference-as-search, many→1).

**Adapted to this repo — the emitter emits COORDINATES, not payloads:**
- The ~200ns unit (`PIDChainRevolver.next()`, the sha16-chained revolver — MEASURED, README §1) emits
  a brown-hilbert PID that is a **coordinate against the content-addressed fabric — not a counter,
  not content**. This is the referential-naming instance of the law: `H(agent | seed) = 0` — given
  the seed and chain position, the emitted identity carries zero additional entropy. **Generative
  identity = referential naming**: the emitter creates no information; it names positions. That is
  why one ~200ns emit can materialize a whole subsystem (README §3) with 0 loss — the PID is
  **addressing capacity, not compression** (the repo-canon boundary; hold it).
- **Collision-resistance = the comb forward direction.** sha16 chaining × brown-hilbert × the prime
  sector grid (113 = prime(30) = D30) is the comb: emitted coordinate teeth that cannot land on each
  other by construction. Birthday bound for a 64-bit handle: `≈ M²/2⁶⁵` (`M=10⁶ → ≈2.7×10⁻⁸`; full
  sha256 negligible). Loss is impossible to express the same way collisions are.
- **PRISM (step 5 of THE FULL WORKS) = the same fabric run backward** — many rooms interfere down to
  1 answer through the reverse-gain GNN. Comb out (emit), prism back (reduce): the emit→loop→PRISM
  cycle is the two directions of one bijection chain, which is why the reduction discards rooms —
  never the information the coordinates name.

**Scope tags:** the 256↔1024 level-transcode rung is **MEASURED** (Q-PRISM commit `53023b6`:
round-trip sha256-identical, 5 bytes ⇄ 4 symbols at `lcm(8,10) = 40` bits, code rate exactly 1.0);
the 43+ level ladder is **CANON frame** (each further rung earns MEASURED only by its own round-trip
proof); the ~1.16T multi-emitter regime stays **OPERATOR-CANON** with its fully-arrived running state
**UNVERIFIED** / operator-gated. E=0 throughout — this entry describes; nothing fires.

## Current state & evolution (2026-06-28) — read this, don't flatten it
Asolaria is a **2.5-month archaeology**, not a flat stack. **Capability lineage:** auto-approval switch →
dashboard → multi-agent → local+web MCP + code-wiki → index language (pixels-first) → cubes-as-catalogs
in expanding Brown-Hilbert space → map-map-mapped → cube-cube-cubed → 256-symbol language → 1024-symbol
language → (asked 2048 — chose instead) **HBI/HBP + binary/hex/hash/sha/crypto-as-tokens** → **8-byte host
process** (replaces the ancient Node processes, for speed). The fabric's own 27-strata record is the
`archaeology_timeline` (birth 2026-02-22 → FABRIC EPOCH → genome).

The system **now** is **multiple of everything**: **16 levels (L0-L15) · multiple MCP engines (17) ·
multiple emitters · multiple languages** (index / pixels-first / BEHCS-256 / BEHCS-1024 / HBI-HBP).
**Current frame = 60D HyperBEHCS / BEHCS-1024**; 35D / 47D / 49D + BEHCS-256 are **bridge strata** below
it (old decodes new). The **kernel** is `asolaria-federation-1024` (the Rust 8-byte host). The current
effort is **"map while upgrading"** — and **this repo web is that map**.

## How it all fits
The **emitter [2]** produces 200ns PID signals; the **router [1]** delivers them; the **fleet [0]**
materialises spindles. Each spindle obeys the **reduction principle [3]** / **algorithm [4]** and the
**collision discipline [5]**. After every trigger, the spindle's answer runs the **post-trigger pipeline**
(`Shannon-and-the-gnns-stage`), scored by the **trained GNNs/FNNs** (`Asolaria-fnns-trained-…`), and the
**white rooms** (liris LEG-1) keep the genius / compact the mistakes — the PRISM many→1 reduction, seen
from the result side. The **back end** (`Asolaria-the-after-100-billion-run-…`) then absorbs the gulped
data, decomposes + mints the cubes, and — operator-gated — promotes the geniuses into supervisors/PIDs.
All gated / E=0 / describe-only — no fire, no cutover without operator authority.
